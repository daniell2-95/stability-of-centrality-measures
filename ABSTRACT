Many real world interactions can be modeled using complex networks,
a mathematical structure in which a set of nodes are connected
by edges, which represent the relationship between them.
The amount of influence a node has in the network is quantified
through a wide variety of centrality measures, each of which has a
different interpretation. In the context of a particular network, it is
unclear which centrality measure is the most meaningful. Here, we
explore one method for comparing different centrality measures:
their stability. In a given network, we calculate the centrality of
the nodes using a particular measure. We then leave each node
out from the network, creating an ensemble of similar networks
and recomputing the centrality of the nodes. We define a measure
using the Kendall-tau distance which counts the number of pairwise
disagreements between the recomputed centrality ordering of
the nodes and the original ordering. We illustrate this method by
comparing the degree, betweenness, closeness, an eigenvector centrality
on real and artificial networks. Our empirical networks are
canonical examples: the Karate-Club, Jazz, Netscience, and Hep-
Th networks. The two artificial networks are the preferential attachment
and small world networks. We illustrate that stability
can be used to distinguish between centrality measures and identify
similarities within ensembles of networks. In future work, we
hope to repeat this process on other networks in hopes of finding
a definite relationship between the type of network and their most
stable centrality measure.
